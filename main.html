<h1>Steph Curry makes NBA history, passing Ray Allen for most three-ponters made</h1>
<h2>The Golden State Warriors point guard has been moving through the record books.</h2>

<p class="byline"><strong>By Ben Morse, CNN</strong></p>

<p>It seems every week <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/10/sport/nikola-jokic-markieff-morris-nba-spt-intl/index.html"target="_blank">NBA</a> superstar <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/11/sport/golden-state-warriors-minnesota-timberwolves-spt-intl/index.html"target="_blank">Steph Curry</a> is making history.<br><br>

Earlier this week, he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/11/sport/golden-state-warriors-minnesota-timberwolves-spt-intl/index.html"target="_blank">overtook</a> Wilt Chamberlain to become the oldest player to record 50 points and 10 assists in a game.<br><br>

And on Friday night, the 33-year-old passed basketball great Ray Allen for the most three-pointers scored in all NBA games, including playoffs, in NBA history.<br><br>

Curry connected with nine of his 17 three-point attempts in the Golden State Warriors' 119-93 win over the Chicago Bulls, taking his tally in regular season and playoff games to 3,366, surpassing Allen's total of 3,358.<br><br>

He had come into the game just one behind two-time NBA champion Allen and equaled his record within the first few minutes of the game.<br><br>

And he became the all-time lead just minutes later, drilling a long-range effort over Alex Caruso.<br><br>

Astonishingly, Curry passed Allen's record in 585 fewer games.<br><br>

Curry ended the night with 40 points, his third 40-point game of the season, as the Warriors accelerated in the second half to beat the high-flying Bulls.</p>

<p>It is the 52nd time in Curry's career that he's scored 40 points or more in a game, as the Warriors continue their blistering start to the season, now with an 11-1 record.<br><br>

Curry is now chasing Allen's regular-season record of 2,973 three-pointers. Curry is on 2,896.<br><br>

The win wraps an eight-game home stand for the Warriors, with the Bay Area team winning seven and losing just once.<br><br>

"In general, the high point is establishing our home floor, that this is going to be a tough place to come win a game," head coach Steve Kerr <a href="https://www.nba.com/warriors/gameday/recap/20211112?_ga=2.66164653.245561546.1636803906-1563778979.1634715704"target="_blank">told</a> the media afterwards.<br><br>

"And a lot of that is the way we're playing. A lot of that is our fans, the energy in the building. There's a really good vibe about the team; the fans feel it.<br><br>

"Great way to start the year but now we've got to go out on the road, and it's going to get a lot tougher. We obviously are very happy to be where we are."</p>
