		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" target="_blank">Data breach hacks</a>, Information Is Beautiful</li>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/" target="_blank">Hip hop vocabulary</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://drones.pitchinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Drones dropped in Pakistan</a>, Pitch Interactive</li>

		</ul>
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<h3>Response to Hip Hop Unique Words Piece</h3>
		<p>In the hip hop vocabulary article, Matt Daniels uses a multitude of dataviz elements to express that hip hop artists use the most unique lyrics out of any other genre. The data itself was first produced in 2014, but was then recently updated in 2019. Daniels starts with a dataviz element similar to that of a plot chart. It has pictures of a bunch of different artists and on the x axis has the number of unique words. This chart is interactive, which allows us to visually see and determine which artist uses a certain amount of unique words. The finding from the chart though is fairly simple, but the way it is presented is easy-on-the-eye and visually appealing. It also creates deeper meaning since it puts names to faces for people unfamiliar with artists in the hip hop genre. 
	<p>The next chart is a simplified version of the previous interactive visual representation. It separates the amount of unique words into ranges, and puts the rapper’s names where they fall in that range. This allows the previous chart to be better comprehended. Additionally, it is another way to show that certain artists use a ton of unique words compared to others. This chart has the look of a symmetrical bar chart, but the content is different and more creative given that there aren’t individual bars for each artist.
<p>The dataviz elements in this project go deeper than just which artist uses the most unique words. There is a chart at the end of the piece that shows how many unique words are used in hip hop compared to any other genre. The graphic is a simple histogram with a header and labels. There is no subhed, but tons of context in the surrounding pieces of text. The colors make the image easy-on-the-eye and easy to understand. 


		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Insert your iframe tag, with your embed code inside, here: --> 

		<iframe src="<iframe title="Amount of United States Troops in Afghanistan, Japan, and Germany in the 2000s" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-vMtMH" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vMtMH/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="564"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></iframe>



  
  		
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
